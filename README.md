# Issue-ify

### The goal of this web app is to connect to artists to the social issues they advocate for such as climate change, lgbtq+ rights, blm, women's right, etc.. This allows the users of my web app to listen to artist who have similar views as themselves while knowing they are supporting artists who want to make a change.
### This web app will also be using the spotify api so users can create playlists as well as listen to music seamlessly. Users will also be able to submit forms to the admin to get new artists added/taken off a certain cause. Thanks for stopping by!
